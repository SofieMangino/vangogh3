        <p>Head of a Skeleton with a Cigarette was one of Van Goghs early paintings. He had been studying anatomy at a school of art where skeletons were not tpically painted but drawn. Van Gogh created this painting as a juvenile joke.</p>

        <p>Although Cafe Terrace at Night is a painting that takes place during the evening, the painting is a devoid of the color black. Van Gogh had written in a letter to his sister stating that the night sky is richer in color than the day.</p>

        <p>Van Gogh had done 35 self portraits during his short years of an artist. During his time in Paris from 1886-88 he was short of money. He wanted to practice painting people but had a hard time hiring models. So his easiest solution was to paint himself.</p>
